# Skincancerdetection

## Objective and Motivation :-
The Objective of this project to construct CNN , Random Forest ,K-NN and Na√Øve baye to predict whether mole whether it is Benign or Malignant and allowing the user to find nearby doctors and making appointment with them .

## Some Facts Related to Skin Cancer 
1.India ranks third in cancer cases after China and the US .

Skin Cancer is primarily diagnosed with visual beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed by dermatologist this where Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can come into to detect skin cancer by training the model with Images of Skin cancer , Helping Customer to save their time and money
